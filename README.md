# Reproducing the Results of the SimCLR Framework
# Group: SAMH

In this project, I attempted to reproduce some of the results of the paper “A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations.” The paper introduces the SimCLR framework, which is targeted to improve the representations created by models with contrastive prediction tasks. The authors of the paper performed various experiments and used their findings to create an optimal contrastive learning framework for visual representations called SimCLR. The main goal I pursue in this project is to reproduce the two key findings in the original paper: (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining ef ective predictive tasks and (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations. The two key findings were then combined to create a final contrastive learning framework for visual representations called SimCLR. Due to memory limitations, the outcomes of the project were not similar to the ones seen in the original paper.

## Running
In order to run the experiments you only have to use the code in the main jupyter notebook.

## Pretrained Models

## Detailed instructions how to submit this project:
1. The assignment will be distributed as a Github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A student's copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name

TODO: Create a directory/file tree
